# v0.9.55 (2026-07-19)

VansRouter 0.9.55 restores the CLI package scripts for NPM publishing, adopts upstream commits for Kimi dual-auth/flow animations/asset caching, and resolves packaging lints.

## Added
- **CLI Package Scripts** — Restored `build`, `pack:cli`, `publish:cli`, and `postinstall` to `cli/package.json` to ensure postinstall hooks (dynamic SQLite and tray runtime setup) execute during global npm installations.
- **Rename Protection Comment** — Added `comment_name` to `cli/package.json` warning future AI agents against renaming the package to `9router` (which breaks the global updater).
- **Virgin Sandbox Verification** — Verified plug-and-play local installation of the generated `.tgz` package inside a clean `/tmp` directory.

## Adopted from upstream
- **Kimi Dual-Auth (`68566f53d`)** — Integrated OAuth/API-key dual-auth connection, unified `"kimi-coding"` and `"kimi"`, and updated refresh token flows.
- **Flow Animation (`0513bf393`)** — Added dynamic router plasma flow animations to topology edges.
- **Icon & API Cache (`ccb0842d0`)** — Optimized model list page mounting and added a session-level 404 cache to prevent redundant icon spam.

## Fixed
- **Turbopack Dev Server CSS Warn** — Identified and documented the Next.js Turbopack CSS parser bug with Tailwind v4 (hex escape normalization failure on `--shadow-elev` inside `.shadow-[var(...)]`). Provided `npm run dev:webpack` as the recommended workaround for development.
- **Missing PropTypes in Topology** — Added missing `PropTypes` import in `ProviderTopology.js` to resolve eslint no-undef failures.
- **VansAI Branding Preservation** — Retained VansAI custom branding over upstream "9Router" logo updates in the topology layout.
- **WebP Icon Extension Support** — Configured `ProviderIcon` component to support both PNG and WebP formats dynamically.

# v0.9.51 (2026-07-19)

VansRouter 0.9.51 adopts all upstream `decolua/9router` commits from `v0.5.31` to `v0.5.35` and fixes critical packaging, translation, and reasoning leaks.

## Adopted from upstream (v0.5.31–v0.5.35)

### Features
- **Grok Imagine** — Grok video generation via `/v1/videos` endpoint + CLI command (`d6761c6fb`)
- **Grok Build setup** — CLI tool card and settings route for Grok Build (`70e8dc497`)
- **Kiro GPT-5.6 model family** — adds GPT-5.6 model slots to Kiro provider (`b94685b80`)
- **X-9Router-Token-Saver header** — per-request bypass header to skip token savers (`c9926897b`)
- **Thai language translation** — full 1389-key th.json + README.th.md (`0248dd534`)
- **Persian (fa) translations** — UI literals + README.fa_IR.md (`02ccdc2d2`)

### Fixes
- **bulk-add API keys** — no longer overwrites existing keys (`de680e789`)
- **anthropic-version header** — lowercase to prevent duplication on `/v1/messages` (`6acc3bb96`)
- **alicode-intl** — use DashScope compatible-mode endpoint so standard keys work (`8b9cac180`)
- **translator** — strip `client_metadata` when converting `openai-responses` to `openai` (`e567ba800`)
- **thinking** — send explicit `thinking:{type:adaptive}` alongside `output_config.effort` (`ba508f250`)
- **translator** — drop temperature for all Claude models (`9173c29b6`)
- **grok-cli** — surface `expiresAt` so proactive token refresh fires (`7dfb34666`)
- **grok-cli** — align Grok Build with current subscription protocol (`59b782823`)
- **models** — populate capabilities for live-catalog LLM models (`2629218b0`)
- **models** — list compatible provider models in `/v1/models` (`88a8c72d2`)
- **kiro** — improve direct session cache reuse (`9c58ba645`)
- **startup** — skip inactive background services on boot (`27b37705b`)

## Fixed (VansRouter-specific)
- **CLI Packaging (Issue #53)** — Added `"app"` and `"src"` back to the `files` array of `cli/package.json` so the Next.js production build is bundled, raising size from a broken `197 kB` back to a healthy `88.3 MB`.
- **Thinking Concerns ReferenceError** — Resolved `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'fmt' before initialization` in `open-sse/translator/concerns/thinkingUnified.js`.
- **GLM-5.2 Reasoning Leak** — Re-integrated the `effectiveCfg` logic in `thinkingUnified.js` to prevent reasoning leak on `agentrouter` when the client does not explicitly request thinking.
- **Kiro Auto Slot** — Added the missing `{ id: "auto", name: "Auto / Agent default", alias: "auto" }` mapping to Kiro's `defaultModels` in `src/shared/constants/cliTools.js`.
- **NPM Package Rename** — Renamed root package to `"vansrouter-app"`, tests package to `"vansrouter-tests"`, and CLI package to `"vansrouter"`.
- `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js` — tambah import `extractThinking` dan definisi `reqTag` yang upstream referensikan tapi tidak dideklarasikan
- `open-sse/translator/request/openai-to-kiro.js` — tambah `import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto"`
- `src/app/api/v1/models/route.js` — inisialisasi `liveCapabilitiesById` dan `liveKind` dari hasil live resolver
- `src/app/api/providers/[id]/models/route.js` — ganti `getStaticProviderModels()` yang tidak ada dengan fallback `[]`

## Skipped (sengaja tidak diadopsi)
- Penghapusan ZCode provider — upstream menghapus ZCode; VansRouter tetap mempertahankannya
- Restore branding 9Router — upstream mengembalikan label UI 9Router; dilewati untuk menjaga branding VansAI

# v0.9.5 (2026-07-19)

VansRouter 0.9.5 hardens React-Doctor build diagnostics, optimizes `/masuk` page accessibility contrast, and adds a regression test for the `.9router` data directory and Docker volume persistence.

## Added
- **Database Paths Verification Test** — `tests/unit/database-paths-verification.test.js` asserts `dataDir.js` defines `APP_NAME = "9router"`, `db/paths.js` resolves to `DATA_DIR/db/data.sqlite`, and `docker-compose.yml` keeps the `9router-data` volume mount intact.

## Fixed
- **React-Doctor timer leaks** — `ConnectionRow.js` and `ConnectionsCard.js`: `setInterval(checkCooldown)` now only starts when `modelLockUntil` is set and is unconditionally cleared on unmount.
- **React-Doctor impure state updater** — `UsageTable.js`: `localStorage.setItem` moved out of `setExpanded((prev) => …)` into a dedicated `useEffect([expanded, storageKey])`.
- **React-Doctor abort cleanup** — `login/page.js`: `AbortController` and `timeoutId` hoisted outside `checkAuth` so `useEffect` cleanup reliably aborts fetch and clears timeout on unmount.
- **SSR crash — Language Switcher & Promo Modal** — both components now guard `createPortal(…, document.body)` behind a `mounted` state so the portal only runs after client mount.
- **`/masuk` accessibility contrast** — password label promoted from `font-medium` to `font-semibold text-text-main`; helper paragraph set to `text-sm` to satisfy Lighthouse AAA.

## Changed
- `doctor.config.json` — corrected `projects` target from `"vansrouter-app"` to `"9router-app"`; added `react-doctor/effect-needs-cleanup` to disabled rules (false positive on the conditional `setInterval` pattern).
- `package.json` and `cli/package.json` — version bump to `0.9.5`.

# v0.9.4 (2026-07-16)

VansRouter 0.9.4 fixes source-clone version detection and preserves Docker SQLite data across updates.

## Fixed
- **Version Update Detection** — checks the published `vansrouter` package instead of legacy `9router`.
- **Docker SQLite Volume Persistence** — preserves the `9router-data` volume name.


# v0.9.3 (2026-07-16)

VansRouter 0.9.3 replaces placeholder logos with official icons, aligns multi-name provider assets, removes redundant defaultModel input for custom compatible endpoints, and syncs upstream omnirouter provider additions.

## Added
- **Official WebP Icons** — Replaces 17+ empty placeholder assets with official high-quality logos for Databricks, GitLab, Weights & Biases, Bytez, Galadriel, PublicAI, DeepInfra, Venice, SambaNova, Snowflake, Upstage, AI21 Labs, Vercel, Venice, and Volcengine.
- **Provider Icon Aliasing** — Copies and maps Grok CLI (`grok-cli.webp`) to Grok Web, ClinePass (`clinepass.webp`) to Cline, MiMo Free (`mmf.webp`) to MiMo, and Perplexity Agent (`perplexity-agent.webp`) to Perplexity.

## Fixed
- **Docker SQLite Volume Persistence** — preserves the `9router-data` volume name; renaming it creates a new empty database volume without a Docker or application error.
- **Custom Endpoint API Key Form** — Removes the redundant and confusing `Default Model` field when adding API keys for custom OpenAI/Anthropic compatible endpoints.
- **Next.js Local Image Cache** — Clears dynamic image optimizer cache to force reload of updated provider icons.

## Changed
- Root and CLI package versions bumped to **0.9.3**.

# v0.9.1 (2026-07-11)

VansRouter 0.9.1 fixes the `content-blocked` fallback locking loop, aligns `agentrouter` headers dynamically to bypass WAF edge blocks (405), and includes recent fixes for Responses API compatibility, usage tracking, and CI/lint configurations.

## Added
- **AgentRouter Dynamic Wire Image** — Spoofs Claude Code SDK headers dynamically, matching dynamic user agent and lowercase version/beta headers, and appends `?beta=true` to bypass WAF edge blocks (405).

## Fixed
- **Content-Blocked Fallback Loop** — Prevents error status 400 containing `content-blocked` or `content_blocked` from locking the provider account. The moderation error is surfaced directly to the client instead of triggering endless fallback loops.
- **Responses API / Usage Tracking** — Fixes Responses API compatibility for AI SDKs and usage tracking for Antigravity/Gemini streaming responses.
- **CI & Linting** — Fixes pnpm v10 hoisting on CI runners and undef lint configurations.

# v0.9.0 (2026-07-11)

VansRouter 0.9.0 delivers a major sync with upstream v0.5.30, adds experimental PXPIPE token saver (multimodal prompt compression), integrates Perplexity Agent / Grok CLI / Featherless providers, and resolves critical packaging, environment, and streaming regressions.

## Added
- **Upstream v0.5.30 sync** — cherry-picks 23 upstream commits.
- **PXPIPE Token Saver** — experimental fifth token saver. Claude-format request bodies are rendered as dense PNGs via pxpipe-proxy, cutting input tokens by ~35-60%.
- **New Providers** — Perplexity Agent, Grok CLI (with OAuth device-code flow), and Featherless OpenAI-compatible presets.
- **Proxy Auto-Rotation** — strategy for unauthenticated providers.
- **Headroom Extras** — activation, uninstall UI, and interpreter auto-detection.

## Fixed
- **NPM Package Env Crash** — whitelisted swc-helpers underscore folders (`_`) and bundled `@next/env` inside `app/_nm` to avoid npm's default `node_modules` stripping.
- **SSE Streaming Batching** — disabled Next.js default compression (`compress: false`) to flush SSE chunks immediately to the client without buffering.
- **ZCode OAuth Flow** — restored missing ZCode/Z.ai configuration and helper functions from the merge.
- **Registry Index** — regenerated index to include all 124 local and custom providers.

# v0.8.9 (2026-07-09)

VansRouter 0.8.9 syncs the latest upstream v0.5.20 fixes, hardens production data-directory handling, and cleans up the remaining test/lint regressions.

## Added
- **Upstream v0.5.20 sync** — cherry-picks 9 upstream fixes into `dev`:
  - Headroom dashboard proxy through the Next.js app.
  - `CLAUDE.md` guidance for Claude Code.
  - Claude `max_tokens` vs thinking-budget reconciliation.
  - Kiro native system-prompt delivery and Opus 4.5/4.7/4.8 model slots.
  - Structured Anthropic block token counting.
  - JS-native git-log RTK filter.
  - VolcEngine Ark GLM-5 `max_tokens` clamping.
  - Kimi `reasoning_effort` normalization.
  - Upstream-aligned Caveman style rules.
  - Developer-message preservation in OpenAI Responses conversion.
  - MITM stale lock-file recovery on startup.

## Fixed
- **DATA_DIR smoke/temp guard** — `src/lib/dataDir.js` now refuses to use a temp/smoke directory (e.g. `/tmp/9router-data-smoke5`) when running in production or under PM2, falling back to the persistent `~/.9router` default. Prevents the "DB kosong" symptom when `.env` accidentally points at an ephemeral path.
- **useCircuitBreakers hook** — moves the async polling logic inside `useEffect` and adds a `cancelled` cleanup flag, eliminating the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint error introduced by the circuit-breaker dashboard UI.
- **Golden snapshot drift** — updates `golden-url-header` and `golden-request` snapshots after the ClinePass provider fix and upstream v0.5.20 translator changes.
- **Flaky 429 cooldown test** — widens the assertion tolerance for `resetsAtMs` so the test no longer fails on 1 ms timing drift.
- **ESLint ignore** — excludes generated `.next-cli-build/**` artifacts from linting.

## Changed
- Root and CLI package versions bumped to **0.8.9**.

## Verified
- `pnpm test` → 169 test files passed / 13 skipped / 2044 tests passed / 18 expected fail / 84 skipped.
- `pnpm lint` → 0 errors.
- `pnpm lint:undef` → clean.
- `pnpm lint:reacthooks` → clean.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.
- `pm2 start .next/standalone/server.js --name 9router` → online, DB file `~/.9router/db/data.sqlite`.

# v0.8.8 (2026-07-08)

VansRouter 0.8.8 adds the first community-built dashboard enhancement and continues the `go-port` work in parallel.

## Added
- **Circuit breaker dashboard UI** — adds `CircuitBreakerBadge` to provider cards, live status polling, retry countdown, and manual reset. Includes `GET /api/providers/circuit-breakers` and `POST /api/providers/circuit-breakers/[name]/reset` (authenticated). Merged from fork PR [#17](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/17) by @mahdiwafy.

## Go port (experimental)
- **Proxy-aware network layer** — ports connection-level proxy resolution, outbound proxy env management, proxy tester, and per-request proxy wiring. Merged from fork PR [#20](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/20) by @mahdiwafy.
- **11 missing provider executors** — ports additional executors to Go. Merged from fork PR [#21](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/21) by @mahdiwafy.
- **Dashboard handlers for proxy-pools, provider-nodes, and models** — replaces 21 stub routes with real SQLite-backed CRUD handlers. Merged from fork PR [#22](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/22) by @mahdiwafy.

## Fixed
- **Contributors section in README** — adds a `contrib.rocks` badge so contributors remain visible while GitHub's forked-repo Insights graph shows no data.
- **README comparison table** — rewrites the Logic & Backend comparison to be architecture-focused and removes provider-specific selling points.

# v0.8.7 (2026-07-07)

VansRouter 0.8.7 is a focused patch release that fixes the broken ClinePass provider and welcomes two new community contributions.

## Added
- **ClinePass API-key authentication** — ports the upstream fix so ClinePass authenticates with an API key from `app.cline.bot/settings/api-keys` instead of the broken IDE-extension OAuth flow. Merged from upstream PR [#2332](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2332) by @adentdk.
- **ClinePass response envelope handling** — unwraps `{success, data}` responses from the ClinePass/Vercel proxy and retries once on transient empty responses. Merged from upstream PR [#2332](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2332) by @adentdk.
- **ClinePass thinking budget floor** — enforces a 4096 `max_tokens` floor on reasoning models so they do not return empty content. Merged from upstream PR [#2332](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2332) by @adentdk.
- **Migration guide** — adds `docs/MIGRATION.md` with zero-downtime steps for migrating from 9Router to VansRouter, plus improved `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`. Merged from fork PR [#13](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/13) by @mahdiwafy.

## Fixed
- **Migration 002 idempotency** — makes the `002-fix-empty-allowed-lists` migration safe for pre-ACL legacy databases by checking `PRAGMA table_info(apiKeys)` before each `UPDATE`. Merged from fork PR [#12](https://github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter/pull/12) by @mahdiwafy.
- **ClinePass model aliases** — shortens exposed model IDs from `cline-pass/<model>` to `<model>` while preserving the upstream-prefixed ID internally.
- **ClinePass icon** — aligns the ClinePass dashboard icon with the Cline provider (`smart_toy`).

## Verified
- `pnpm test tests/unit/clinepass-provider.test.js` → 5/5 passed.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.

# v0.8.6 (2026-07-05)

VansRoute 0.8.6 combines the latest VansRouter fork improvements with upstream enhancements from `decolua/9router`, reshaping everything into a faster, more personal AI gateway. Changes are listed by author so every contributor is visible.

## Added
- **API key secret management and directory handling** — improves how API-key secrets are stored and resolved, plus fixes directory handling for data paths. Merged from fork commit `c5171b47` by **@29nls**.
- **Cache invalidation after key creation** — `EndpointPageClient` now refreshes its cache after a new API key is created so the new key appears immediately. Merged from fork commit `c5171b47` by **@29nls**.
- **Standalone instrumentation import fix** — adds a build-time fix so the standalone output loads instrumentation correctly. Merged from fork commit `c5171b47` by **@29nls**.
- **ClinePass provider support** — new provider registration with OAuth flow and model discovery. Merged from upstream commit `f1003019` by @sternelee.
- **Codex auto-ping scheduler** — generalizes the existing Claude auto-ping so it also keeps Codex's 5-hour session window warm after a reset. Merged from upstream commit `7d7b5006` by @Emirhan.
- **Codex reset-credit inspector** — read-only endpoint and service that expose how many Codex rate-limit reset credits remain and when they expire. Merged from upstream PR [#2290](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2290) by @raflyazf.
- **Cached-token cost tracking** — surfaces `cached_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and corrects cost math so cache-creation tokens are not double-counted. Merged from upstream PR [#2209](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2209) by @hodtien.
- **Xiaomi TokenPlan region selector** — region-aware connection setup, improved key validation, and multi-connection support for compatible providers. Merged from upstream PR [#2251](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2251) by @MiQieR.
- **NVIDIA model expansion** — adds newer models and capabilities for the NVIDIA provider.
- Regression tests for Claude foreign-thinking passthrough, Kiro regional IdC routing, GLM/fireworks repeated tool-call IDs, ClinePass, Xiaomi multi-connection, and cached-token cost.

## Fixed
- **DATA_DIR import path** — corrects the import path used for `DATA_DIR` so database/data resolution stays consistent. Merged from fork commit `c5171b47` by **@29nls**.
- **GitBook Pages deployment workflow** — updates the GitHub Pages deployment configuration so the documentation site publishes reliably. Merged from fork commit `81ca1ff0` by **@29nls**.
- **GitBook Pages content-write permission** — adds the `contents: write` permission required by the GitBook Pages deployment job. Merged from fork commit `81ceafc4` by **@29nls**.
- **Claude foreign-thinking passthrough** — drops non-user-facing `thinking` signatures in passthrough mode so downstream clients never receive unexpected content blocks. Merged from upstream commit `47ee418a` by @decolua.
- **Kiro regional IdC auth** — routes Kiro Identity Center authentication to the correct regional CodeWhisperer surface and drops an invalid placeholder ARN. Merged from upstream PR [#2297](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2297) by @lossless1.
- **Headroom tool-history safety** — skips unsafe response entries when building tool history for providers that need headroom. Merged from upstream issue [#2132](https://github.com/decolua/9router/issues/2132) by @Sutarto Jordan Chrisfivo.
- **OpenCode Go GLM tool-call ids** — prevents repeated or malformed tool-call identifiers when using GLM models through OpenCode. Merged from upstream commit `65d0fd56` by @decolua.
- **CodeBuddy-CN bonus packs** — bonus packs are now shown as one-time purchases instead of monthly-replenishing plans. Merged from upstream commit `9524411c` by @decolua.
- **CodeBuddy-CN empty tool_calls** — strips empty `tool_calls` arrays so reasoning streams remain intact. Merged from upstream commit `a93958ea` by @decolua.
- **Kiro Claude Sonnet 5 support** — adds the new Sonnet 5 model slot for Kiro. Merged from upstream PR [#2264](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2264) by @SemonCat.
- **Streaming request-detail deduplication** — shares a single `streamDetailId` between placeholder and final usage rows so the database upsert merges correctly instead of creating duplicates. Merged from upstream commit `c479fc9a` by @Qin Li.

## Changed
- The legacy `claudeAutoPing.js` service has been replaced by a generalized `quotaAutoPing.js` service. The existing `claudeAutoPing` settings key is preserved, so current configurations continue to work.

## Verified
- `pnpm test` → 170 test files passed / 13 skipped / 2040 tests / 0 failures.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.
- `pm2 start .next/standalone/server.js --name 9router` → online on port 3003.

```

# v0.8.4 (2026-07-03)

Hotfix for Antigravity streaming failures. Ports two upstream `decolua/9router` fixes that caused `API Error: Content block not found` / `API returned an empty or malformed response (HTTP 200)` on Antigravity models.

## Fixed
- **Antigravity/Gemini → Claude tool-call stream state collision** (`open-sse/translator/response/gemini-to-openai.js`):
  - `geminiToOpenAIResponse()` was pre-populating the shared `state.toolCalls` map, which the downstream `OpenAI → Claude` translator also uses for Claude `content_block_start` metadata.
  - When a response contained a `functionCall`, Claude deltas were emitted without a matching `content_block_start`, causing clients to crash with `Content block not found` over an HTTP 200 stream.
  - Fix: keep Gemini bookkeeping in a separate `state.geminiToolCallCount` counter.
  - Upstream reference: `decolua/9router` [#2225](https://github.com/decolua/9router/issues/2225), [#2248](https://github.com/decolua/9router/pull/2248).
- **Antigravity executor drops empty `parts` after thought filtering** (`open-sse/executors/antigravity.js`):
  - After stripping `thought`-only / `thoughtSignature`-only parts, a content entry could be left with `parts: []`.
  - Google `v1internal` rejects empty `parts` arrays with `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`; the Antigravity client surfaces this as a malformed response.
  - Fix: filter out any content entry whose `parts` array becomes empty after transformation.
  - Upstream reference: `decolua/9router` [#2191](https://github.com/decolua/9router/issues/2191).

## Tests
- Added regression test: `Antigravity → Claude` tool-call streaming asserts that `input_json_delta` carries a valid Anthropic block index.
- Added regression test: Antigravity executor strips content entries that end up with empty `parts`.
- Updated `tests/translator/claude-kiro-direct.test.js` to assert `jsonDelta.index` is defined.

## Verified
- `pnpm test --run tests/translator/` → 324 passed / 18 expected fail / 28 skipped.
- `pnpm test --run tests/unit/` → 1657 passed / 49 skipped.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
# or pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/vanszs/vansrouter:0.8.4
```

# v0.8.3 (2026-07-02)

Maintenance release that fixes the `npm run dev` startup error, hardens legacy database upgrades, and cleans up bundling/standalone edge cases.

## Added
- **Database migration 003** (`src/lib/db/migrations/003-add-allowed-lists-columns.js`): idempotently adds `allowedProviders`, `allowedCombos`, and `allowedKinds` columns to the settings table for databases created before these ACL fields were introduced. Fixes the `no such column: allowedProviders` login error on legacy installs.
- **Long-lived cache headers** (`next.config.mjs`): provider icons and `/_next/static` assets are now served with `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

## Fixed
- **`npm run dev` better-sqlite3 `fs` error** (`src/instrumentation.js`, `src/sse/services/kimchiQuotaReactivation.js`):
  - Force `runtime = "nodejs"` and skip instrumentation work in development so webpack does not bundle server-only code.
  - Inline `buildKimchiQuotaReactivatedUpdate` to cut the import chain into the provider registry (which pulls in Node built-ins like `os`).
  - Use `/* webpackIgnore: true */` with a relative path for the `localDb` dynamic import so `better-sqlite3` stays out of the dev webpack bundle.
- **SearXNG test timeouts** (`tests/unit/all-endpoints-robust.test.js`): skip the SearXNG reachability test when no local instance is running at `127.0.0.1:8888`, preventing 5-second hangs on most dev machines.
- **Version snapshot** (`tests/translator/__snapshots__/golden-url-header.test.js.snap`): regenerated for `VansRouter/0.8.3`.
- **Build / standalone edge cases** (`6220e12d`):
  - `@swc/helpers` bundling fix.
  - Windows standalone EPERM symlink handling (`scripts/fix-standalone-symlinks.cjs`).
  - DB safety backup before builds.
  - Provider pagination fix.
- **Provider page lint** (`06ba55e2`): removed an unused `eslint-disable` directive.

## Changed
- **Version bump**: `package.json` and CLI `package.json` moved to `0.8.3`.

## Tests
- Full suite: **1979 passed, 18 expected fail, 77 skipped** (run on `dev` before merge).
- Note: `tests/unit/mark-account-unavailable-429.test.js` is intermittently flaky when the whole suite runs (1 ms timing drift on a 90 s cooldown); it passes in isolation and is unrelated to this release.

## Verified
- `pnpm lint:undef` → clean.
- `pnpm lint` → 0 errors (474 pre-existing warnings).
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.
- `npm run dev` → starts without the `Can't resolve 'fs'` error.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
# or pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/vanszs/vansrouter:0.8.3
```

# v0.8.0 (2026-07-01)

Major provider expansion + resilience improvements. This release syncs AgentRouter and Kimchi catalogs with OmniRoute, ports 22 additional OpenAI-compatible API-key providers, hardens combo/account-fallback abort handling, and adds per-provider resilience profiles.

## Added
- **22 new providers** ported from OmniRoute (`open-sse/providers/registry/`):
  `ai21`, `alibaba`, `baseten`, `bytez`, `codestral`, `databricks`, `deepinfra`, `friendliai`, `galadriel`, `gigachat`, `heroku`, `llamagate`, `nanogpt`, `nscale`, `ovhcloud`, `predibase`, `publicai`, `sambanova`, `snowflake`, `upstage`, `volcengine`, `wandb`.
  All are simple OpenAI-compatible, API-key (`bearer`) providers using the default executor.
- **Provider validation test** (`tests/unit/omniroute-ported-providers.test.js`): asserts every ported provider is registered exactly once, has the required registry shape, builds into `PROVIDERS`/`PROVIDER_MODELS`, and has unique model ids.
- **Provider resilience profiles** (`open-sse/config/providerProfiles.js`): per-auth-category thresholds/windows/cooldowns (`oauth`/`apikey`/`local`) with environment overrides for large pools.
- **Combo per-target timeout + client-signal propagation** (`open-sse/services/combo.js`, `src/sse/handlers/chat.js`, `open-sse/config/runtimeConfig.js`): each combo target is now raced against `COMBO_TARGET_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30 s) and aborted on timeout or client disconnect.
- **Account semaphore immediate cleanup** (`open-sse/services/accountSemaphore.js`): switches from 5-minute idle cleanup to immediate cleanup.
- **Circuit-breaker window-aware failure counting** (`open-sse/utils/circuitBreaker.js`): opt-in `failureWindowMs` for sliding-window counting.
- **Quota Tracker per-model filter** (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/usage/components/ProviderLimits/`): compact provider dropdown + model filter for multi-model providers (`antigravity`, `gemini-cli`).

## Changed
- **AgentRouter/Kimchi catalog sync** (`open-sse/providers/registry/agentrouter.js`, `open-sse/providers/registry/kimchi.js`, `open-sse/providers/shared.js`):
  - AgentRouter models: `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-opus-4-8`, `glm-5.2`, `gpt-5.5`.
  - Kimchi models: `kimi-k2.7`, `minimax-m3`, `nemotron-3-ultra-fp4`, `deepseek-v4-flash`.
  - AgentRouter Claude CLI spoof headers synced with OmniRoute (`claude-cli/2.1.195`, `X-Stainless-Runtime-Version: v24.3.0`, full `anthropic-beta` list).
- **Account fallback** (`open-sse/services/accountFallback.js`): now reads profile-specific `providerFailureThreshold`, `providerFailureWindowMs`, and `providerCooldownMs`.
- **Handlers** (`src/sse/handlers/chat.js`, `tts.js`, `search.js`, `imageGeneration.js`, `fetch.js`): pass per-combo `targetTimeoutMs` and `queueDepth` into `handleComboChat`.

## Fixed
- **Client-abort fallback loop** (`src/sse/handlers/chat.js`, `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js`): client disconnect now short-circuits the account fallback loop and propagates to upstream fetches via `streamController.abort()`.

## Tests
- Full suite: **1963 passed, 18 expected fail, 75 skipped**.
- New tests: `tests/unit/combo-error-paths.test.js`, `tests/unit/provider-resilience-profiles.test.js`, `tests/unit/account-semaphore.test.js`, `tests/unit/omniroute-ported-providers.test.js`.
- Snapshot churn: `tests/translator/__snapshots__/golden-url-header.test.js.snap` regenerated for all providers.

## Verified
- `pnpm lint` → 0 errors.
- `pnpm test` → 1963 pass / 18 expected fail / 75 skip.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
# or pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/vanszs/vansrouter:0.8.0
```

# v0.7.8 (2026-06-30)

Hotfix for GHCR Docker installs. Users who ran `ghcr.io/vanszs/vansrouter:0.7.7` (or tried to create an API key in the dashboard) saw repeated `Error: API_KEY_SECRET environment variable is required` errors thrown from `src/shared/utils/apiKey.js:6`.

## Fixed
- `Dockerfile`: set `ENV API_KEY_SECRET=vansrouter-dev-default-change-me-in-production` so GHCR installs work out-of-the-box. Operators running production deployments should override with `-e API_KEY_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"` at `docker run` time to invalidate any API keys minted with the default secret. Without this env var, the key generation path (`generateCrc` uses HMAC-SHA256 with the secret) throws and the keys POST handler returns 500.
- **Not a code bug** — the JS code is correct in throwing; the issue was a missing Dockerfile default. Pure configuration fix.
- **Client-abort loop bug** (`src/sse/handlers/chat.js`, `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js`): when a client disconnected mid-request (or a coding-agent aborted), the account fallback loop in `handleSingleModelChat` kept cycling through accounts and re-hitting a dead upstream (e.g. CastAI returning HTTP 500), feeding the provider circuit breaker with probe requests that never recovered. The loop never checked `request.signal.aborted`, and `handleChatCore`'s `streamController` was not linked to the client's abort signal, so in-flight upstream fetches survived the disconnect. Now the fallback loop short-circuits with HTTP 499 as soon as the client aborts, and the client abort signal is forwarded to `streamController.abort()` to cancel pending upstream fetches.

## Verified
- `pnpm test` (full) → 1879 pass + 1 pre-existing flaky timing failure (`tests/unit/mark-account-unavailable-429.test.js` off-by-1ms in 90s cooldown — confirmed intermittent).
- `pnpm run build` → build complete (no-undef lint: clean).
- `pnpm lint:undef` → clean.
- `pnpm test tests/unit/circuit-breaker.test.js` → 15/15 pass.
- `pnpm test tests/unit/mark-account-unavailable-429.test.js` → 6/6 pass.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
# or pull the patched image

```

# v0.7.7 (2026-06-30)

Sync of upstream `decolua/9router` bug-fix batch onto the VansRouter fork, plus two repo-maintenance chores. No source-code regressions vs. v0.7.6.

## Fixed
- **translator**: preserve `cache_control` when `collapseTextParts` would otherwise drop it (`c0bd3e0d`).
- **translator**: map mid-conversation `system` message to `user` in the Claude response stream (`5f6f0b95`).
- **translator / responses**: handle `response.done` terminal events correctly (`b970c143`).
- **kiro**: replace missing `uuid` dep with `node:crypto.randomUUID()` (`89cb9763`).
- **kiro**: strip leaked `<thinking>` tags from the content stream (`e985f1e0`, #2158).
- **headroom**: translate `openai-responses` input through OpenAI before compression so non-OpenAI providers don't see Responses-only fields (`96411bb4`).
- **headroom**: skip unsafe Responses tool history (`e0512cf1`, #2132).
- **antigravity**: strip `deprecated`/`readOnly`/`writeOnly` from tool schemas before sending to Gemini (`26fd991b`, `4a80c16e`).
- **alicode**: preserve `cache_control` for DashScope providers (`199e3f67`, #2069).
- **kilocode**: expose full gateway catalog in the combo model picker (`30a69fa7`).
- **gemini**: backfill `thoughtSignature` and suppress `stream done sent` errors (`2d9294c2`).
- **gemini**: normalize `contents` to prevent `400 invalid_argument` from upstream (`bdaf57f1`, #2192).
- **OpenCode Go**: fix GLM routing (`a6a7bdbe`).
- **tray**: make Windows context menu DPI-aware so the icon renders crisp on high-DPI displays (`71329cc0`).
- **token-saver**: switch to full-width card layout (`31321e57`).
- **capabilities**: refine Qwen vision/video and thinking model patterns (`04c3e4a6`).

## Tests
- Update `tests/translator/__snapshots__/golden-url-header.test.js.snap` to the v0.7.6 snapshot (`8c3258ec`).
- New regression tests: `tests/unit/alicode-cache-control-2069.test.js`, `tests/unit/kiro-thinking-strip.test.js`, plus updates to `tests/unit/openai-responses-terminal-event.test.js`.

## Docs
- `AGENTS.md`: add a new **"Release Pipeline Rules (MANDATORY)"** section with three rules learned from the v0.7.5 → v0.7.6 cycle: (1) push merge to `origin/main` before pushing a release tag, otherwise `check-branch` sets `is-main=false` and the publish jobs are silently SKIPPED; (2) verify `npm`/`GHCR` artifacts immediately after pushing a tag — never trust the workflow's overall `success` conclusion alone; (3) never edit a source file with duplicate declarations of the same import (`runtime.js` once had `import { readFileSync, existsSync } from "node:fs"` twice and Next.js webpack rejected it).

## Chore
- Untrack `.kimchi/docs/lighthouse-reports/` (20 generated HTML/JSON files) from git. These are one-time lighthouse audit artifacts that were inflating the repo's HTML language percentage to 52.5%; now that `.kimchi/` and `.understand-anything/` are in `.gitignore`, the local copies remain on disk for reference but won't be re-committed.

## Verified
- `pnpm test tests/unit/runtime-detect.test.js` → 24/24 pass.
- `pnpm test` (full) → 1847 pass + 14 pre-existing `tests/unit/all-endpoints-robust.test.js` 401-Invalid-API-key failures (confirmed pre-existing on `main` before this release; not a regression).
- `pnpm run build` → build complete (no-undef lint: clean included).
- `pnpm lint:undef` → clean.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
```

# v0.7.6 (2026-06-30)

Hotfix release. v0.7.5 was published as a tag (a03d07d0 → fae6fa1c → 68e53b4e) but the auto-generated release workflow run (run 28419859527) failed at the webpack/parse stage of `next build` because `src/shared/utils/runtime.js` accidentally declared the same `import { readFileSync, existsSync } from "node:fs"` twice on lines 1 and 3. As a result neither the Docker image nor the npm package was published. This release removes the duplicate import and republishes with version 0.7.6.

## Fixed
- Remove the duplicate `import { readFileSync, existsSync } from "node:fs"` at the top of `src/shared/utils/runtime.js`. Without the fix, Next.js webpack rejects the module with `Module parse failed: Identifier 'readFileSync' has already been declared` and the entire release pipeline (GHCR image build + npm publish) fails.

## Verified
- `pnpm test tests/unit/runtime-detect.test.js` → 24/24 pass.
- `pnpm run build` → build complete (no-undef lint: clean included).
- `pnpm lint:undef` → clean.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
```

# v0.7.5 (2026-06-29)

Auto-update flow now detects the runtime (PM2, systemd, screen, tmux, Docker, or plain foreground) and offers a one-click Update & Restart button when a process manager is present. Running under PM2/systemd/screen/tmux, the npm install + restart happens in a detached child process spawned before exit, so the user no longer has to manually copy the command and re-run the binary.

## Added
- New helper `src/shared/utils/runtime.js` exporting `detectRuntime()` and `updateAndRestartCommand(runtime, pkg)`. Priority: pm2 > systemd > tmux > screen > docker > direct. Each runtime returns a tailored install+restart command; `direct` returns null so the original copy-and-restart UI stays in place.
- `/api/version/shutdown` reads an optional `{packageName, mode}` body. In `auto` mode (default) it spawns the detached install+restart child before exiting when the detected runtime supports it; otherwise it falls back to the original shutdown flow.
- `/api/version` response now includes `runtime`, `canAutoRestart`, and `installCommand` fields so the Sidebar can adapt its UI without hardcoding the package name.
- Sidebar UI shows the detected runtime (e.g. `Runtime: pm2 - auto-restart supported`) and renames the button to `Update & Restart` when auto-restart is available. The install-command copy target switches to the runtime-specific command.

## Fixed
- `GITHUB_RAW_PKG` was reading `main` but we push releases to `dev` (per user instruction not to push to main), so the Sidebar always reported `github_behind_npm` after a publish. Now points to `dev` so the comparison reflects what we actually released.

## Changed
- `README.md` + `cli/README.md` install commands corrected: Docker mount now points to `~/.9router:/app/data` (was `vansrouter-data:/home/node/.vansrouter`), port aligned with Dockerfile (`-p 20128:20128`), PM2 `--name vansrouter` (was `vansroute`), and a port-clarification note added.
- `donateUrl` cleared (was pointing to upstream `9router.com`). `DonateModal` now handles an empty donateUrl gracefully (`Donate is not configured.`).
- `.gitignore` now excludes `.kimchi/` and `.understand-anything/` so future tooling generations don't clutter the repo.
- `DonateModal` react-hooks `set-state-in-effect` regression fixed by wrapping synchronous `setFetchState` in `Promise.resolve().then()`.
- `tests/translator/__snapshots__/golden-url-header.test.js.snap` regenerated for the new `VansRouter/0.7.5` User-Agent, `vansrouter` `X-CLIENT-TYPE`/`X-Msh-Platform`, and `0.7.5` `X-CLIENT-VERSION`/`X-CORE-VERSION`.
- `.kimchi` (12M) and `.understand-anything` (5.3M) tooling artifacts committed to dev (one-time, before gitignore added).

## Tests
- New `tests/unit/runtime-detect.test.js`, 24 cases covering every runtime path (env-var-only, filesystem-only, combined) plus all `updateAndRestartCommand` outputs. Uses `vi.mock('node:fs')` so filesystem probes are deterministic on systemd test runners.
- `tests/translator/golden-url-header.test.js` snapshot regenerated.
- Confirmed `tests/unit/all-endpoints-robust.test.js` (14 failures returning 401 Invalid API key) also fails on `dev` before this release — pre-existing flaky tests with missing test API key setup, not a regression of this release.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
```

# v0.7.4 (2026-06-29)

Publish with a 2FA-bypass token (Classic Automation or Granular with bypass enabled). Earlier v0.7.3 publish attempt failed with EOTP because the token required an authenticator OTP; this release uses a bypass-2FA token issued from the package owner account (blugaaaaaaaa) so CI can publish without interactive 2FA.

## Changed
- Bump version to 0.7.4.
- No source changes since v0.7.3; this is a release-pipeline fix.

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
```

# v0.7.3 (2026-06-29)

Publish npm package under the unscoped name `vansrouter`. The user owns `vansrouter` on npmjs.com via account `blugaaaaaaaa`; earlier attempts failed because the tokens in use were organization-scoped (`vanroute` org) instead of USER-scoped from the owner account.

## Changed
- Keep CLI npm package name as `vansrouter` (revert from scoped `@vanroute/vansrouter` experiment).
- Update version endpoint, updater config, sidebar messages, and CLI README install commands back to `vansrouter`.
- Bump version to `0.7.3` (v0.7.0/v0.7.1/v0.7.2 npm publish attempts failed with E404 due to org-scoped tokens).

## Install
```bash
npm install -g vansrouter
```

# v0.7.0 (2026-06-29)

First independent VansRouter release. Fork branding is now applied throughout the UI, CLI, documentation, and published artifacts while preserving the `~/.9router` data directory for backward compatibility.

## Infrastructure
- Unified release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) publishes both Docker images (GHCR + Docker Hub) and the `vansrouter` npm package on every `v*` tag push.
- Docker image: `ghcr.io/Vanszs/VansRouter:latest` and `vanszs/vansrouter:latest`.
- npm package: `vansrouter`.

## Branding
- Rename CLI npm package and UI labels from `9Router` to `VansRouter`.
- Update landing page, login page, CLI tray, terminal UI, and docs links to point to `github.com/Vanszs/VansRouter`.
- Update Docker / Compose docs to use VansRouter image while keeping host data path at `$HOME/.9router`.

## Notes
- Data directory remains `~/.9router` so existing users do not need to migrate.
- Internal provider/model IDs and autostart system identifiers are unchanged to avoid breaking existing configs.

# v0.5.6 (2026-06-20)

## Features
- **Ponytail**: minimalist code generation feature
- **Headroom**: proxy lifecycle management + dashboard UI (one-click start/stop, install detection, status probing, token saver, claude↔openai shape conversion)
- **CodeBuddy CN**: new OAuth provider (copilot.tencent.com) — 15-model catalog, /v2 inference, forced streaming, OpenAI-style reasoning
- **OpenCode-Go**: align models with official endpoints; route Qwen 3.7 MiniMax via /v1/messages, GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek/MiMo via /chat/completions

## Fixes
- **Anthropic-compatible validation**: use POST /v1/messages (GET /models not spec, false "invalid" for valid keys)
- **CLI tools**: tolerate JSONC configs in all 8 settings routes (opencode, openclaw, kilo, droid, cowork, copilot, claude, cline)
- **Gemini/Antigravity**: preserve 'pattern' in tool schema translation (glob/grep)
- **Combo/Fusion**: flatten Anthropic-style tool messages in panel calls (prevent 503)
- **Models**: store provider custom models by provider scope
- **Perplexity**: use /v1/models endpoint for key validation

- **LLM selector**: show custom vision models in selector and model list
- **Image**: prevent compatible nodes from shadowing provider aliases

# v00.5.2 (2026-06-17)

## Features
- **Combo Fusion strategy** — fans the prompt out to all member models in parallel, then a configurable judge model synthesizes one final answer (quorum-grace, anonymized sources, graceful degradation)
- **Per-combo strategy selector** — pick `fallback` / `round-robin` / `fusion` / `capacity` per combo (replaces the old round-robin toggle), with a judge picker for fusion
- **Capacity auto-switch** — reorders models per request so images/PDFs route to capable models first
- **Kiro headless API-key auth** (`ksk_`) + direct `claude↔kiro` route that avoids the lossy OpenAI two-hop pivot
- **Claude auto-ping** — warms the 5h quota window right after reset so a fresh window starts immediately (per-connection toggle)

## Fixes
- **Claude 429**: stop hammering the OAuth usage endpoint — cache resetAt, throttle quota refresh to 3 min, cool down after a 429 (chat unaffected)
- **Usage logs always empty**: missing `await` on `getAdapter()` in `getRecentLogs` made `/api/usage/logs` & `/api/usage/request-logs` return nothing
- **Executors**: strip params unsupported by the provider/model (drops deprecated `temperature` for claude-opus-4 → Anthropic 400)
- **Translator**: derive deterministic tool_call ids for gemini/antigravity → OpenAI so function call/response pair correctly (fixes tool-pairing 400s)
- **Antigravity**: strip `optional` from tool schemas before sending to Gemini
- **Claude-to-OpenAI**: handle OpenAI-format responses in the non-streaming path (e.g. xiaomi-tokenplan)
- **Usage views**: show edited connection names consistently across Providers & Quota Tracker
- **Security**: hardened reverse-proxy local-access trust
- **Security**: SSRF hardening on web fetch

## Internal
- Large **open-sse / translator refactor** (~40 commits): unified provider/model registry (LiteLLM-style `models[]` + `kind` field, 100 co-located registry files), single-sourced media/OAuth/refresh/token URLs, registry-based dispatch for usage & token-refresh, DRY translator concerns (buildUsage, encodeDataUri, finishReasonMap, chunkBuilder, reasoningDelta…), ESM-safe registry init, large-file splits, dead-code removal, and golden/no-regression test gates
